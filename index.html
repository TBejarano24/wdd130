        <p>I'm Tomas Bejarano, I live in Buenos Aires, Argentina and I aspire to become a Full Stack Web Developer! I
            also like art in many forms, I enjoy music, pottery, painting, literature, but above all I love drawing. I
            enjoy doing things that involve creativity, which is why I like web development among all branches of
            programming. Other than this, here's some extra info: My favorite food is pizza (though it sounds pretty
            basic, it's true) because it is related to some of the most precious moments of my life. Among all kinds of
            music I enjoy J-pop above all, and my favorite singer is Ado (She's famous because of her ferocity when
            singing, but I also enjoy her quieter songs), because of this you can also guess that I like japanese as a
            language, and it is true. I try to study japanese daily, although I don't dedicate too much time to it, I've
            been improving a lot on my reading comprehension.</p>

        <p>Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires is the capital city of Argentina, it is built around the Río de La Plata
            river which has been for long the main economic tool of the country as well as a touristic site. This is a
            picture of Puerto Madero, one of the 'barrios' of the city.</p>
